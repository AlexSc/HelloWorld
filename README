This is an example of a static lib which can compile into a standard command
line application or to an NPAPI plugin which exposes the interface of the
static lib.  It is more or less completely self contained, though in addition
to a standard sane dev environment (gcc on Linux/OS X, some version of VC++
and the MS Platform SDK on Windows) you will need

1) Python 2.x.  This project has been tested with 2.5.x and 2.6.x.
2) SCons 1.2.0 or later.  This project has been tested with SCons 1.2.0 stable
and SCons 1.2.0.d20090919. (http://scons.org)
3) On Windows, you will need the Python for Windows Extensions
(http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/).

After installing all dependencies you can build the project by running `scons`
in the root level directory (you know, the one that this file is in).  By
default that will build the library, cli app, and NPAPI plugin in a release
configuration.

For more information on how to create a crossplatform NPAPI plugin, see
Docs/XPlatform Plugin.txt, and then be very very happy that this example
takes care of all the described details for you.

For more information on the options available to the build scripts used
in this example and the additions made to SCons in site_scons/, see
Docs/SCons Notes.txt.

If you woud like to be my personal hero, make this sample work in
Internet Explorer.
